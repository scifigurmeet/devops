# Setting Up a Maven Project with GitHub and GitHub Actions

This guide walks you through:

1. Setting up a Maven project locally.
2. Initializing it as a Git project.
3. Testing Maven commands.
4. Pushing it to GitHub.
5. Using GitHub Actions to build a `.jar` file and upload it to the repo.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Java (JDK 8 or later)
- Maven installed (`mvn -v`)
- Git installed
- GitHub account

---

## ‚ö° Step 1: Create a Maven Project Locally

```bash
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.app -DartifactId=myapp -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

Navigate into the project:

```bash
cd myapp
```

---

## ‚öñ Step 2: Initialize Git Repo

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Create a GitHub repo (manually or via CLI), then add it as remote:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/myapp.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## üîß Step 3: Test Maven Commands

Build the project:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Check the generated JAR file:

```bash
ls target/*.jar
```

Run the JAR file (if it has a `main` method):

```bash
java -cp target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.app.App
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Set Up GitHub Actions

Create directory and file:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/maven-build.yml
```

### `maven-build.yml` Content

```yaml
name: Build and Package JAR

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '17'

      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn clean package

      - name: Upload artifact to repo
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: myapp-jar
          path: target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

---

## üéà Step 5: Access the JAR from GitHub Actions

1. After a push to `main`, go to **Actions** tab.
2. Select the workflow run.
3. Under **Artifacts**, download `myapp-jar`.

---

## üöÄ Final Tips

- You can modify `pom.xml` for more dependencies or plugins.
- Use `mvn test` to run unit tests.
- Store secrets (like deploy credentials) in GitHub secrets.

Happy Building! ‚ú®
