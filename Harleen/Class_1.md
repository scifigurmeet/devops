# DevOps in Industry: A Senior Engineer's Perspective on Career Paths, Roles, and Industry Reality

## Opening Narrative: The Real DevOps Journey

### My Journey: From Campus to Senior DevOps Engineer
Let me start by sharing my journey from where you are sitting right now to where I am today as a Senior DevOps Engineer at Accenture. Back in 2020, I was just like you - a final year student at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, wondering what DevOps really meant beyond the textbook definitions.

timeline
    title My DevOps Evolution (2020-2024)
    2020 : College Graduate : - First exposure to automation<br>- Built basic CI pipeline for final project<br>- Learned Git and Linux basics
    2020 : Independent Consultant : - Worked with startups<br>- Hands-on cloud experience<br>- Implemented basic Docker solutions
    2021 : DevOps Associate at Accenture : - Enterprise-level exposure<br>- CI/CD implementation<br>- Cloud infrastructure management
    2023 : DevOps Engineer : - Led migration projects<br>- Kubernetes implementations<br>- Multi-cloud architecture
    2024 : Senior DevOps Engineer : - Leading team of 8<br>- Architecting cloud solutions<br>- Mentoring junior engineers
```

### The Reality vs. Expectations
When I started my journey, here's what I thought DevOps was vs. what I discovered:

#### Initial Expectations
1. Just automation and scripting
2. Only about tools and technology
3. Separate from development
4. Limited to deployment

#### Industry Reality
1. Business transformation enabler
2. Cultural shift in organizations
3. End-to-end delivery ownership
4. Strategic business impact
