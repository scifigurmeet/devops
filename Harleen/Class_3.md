# Azure DevOps: From Theory to Production - A Senior Engineer's Perspective

## Introduction: Why Azure DevOps?

When I started my journey at Accenture, the most common question I encountered was: "Why do enterprises choose Azure DevOps over other platforms?" Having worked with multiple platforms across different organizations, I can now explain the compelling reasons behind Azure's dominance in the enterprise space.

### The Enterprise Advantage

```

Let me share a real scenario from my banking sector experience:

We had to manage a development team of 5000+ developers across three continents with different access levels and compliance requirements. The challenge wasn't just about managing code â€“ it was about:
- Ensuring regulatory compliance
- Maintaining security standards
- Managing access controls
- Tracking every change for audits
- Enabling collaboration
- Maintaining performance

## Understanding Azure DevOps Components

### 1. Azure Boards: Project Management Reimagined

    B --> C[Active Sprint]
    C --> D[Daily Tasks]
    D --> E[Sprint Review]
    E --> F[Sprint Retrospective]
    F --> B

    E
    F
    end
    
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style C fill:#69f,stroke:#333
```

Real-World Application:
In my current role, we've customized Azure Boards to:
- Track features across 20 teams
- Automate status updates
- Generate compliance reports
- Integrate with customer systems

### 2. Azure Pipelines: The Deployment Journey
