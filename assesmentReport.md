  - Completes most tasks with minimal guidance
  - Shows solid understanding of tools
  - Maintains good documentation
- **Satisfactory (60-74%)**:
  - Completes basic tasks
  - Demonstrates basic tool knowledge
  - Basic documentation skills
- **Needs Improvement (<60%)**:
  - Requires constant guidance
  - Limited tool understanding
  - Poor documentation

### 2. Class Assessments
Each assessment focuses on specific modules and practical implementation:

#### Theory Subjects:
- **CA1**: Fundamentals and basic concepts
- **CA2**: Tool implementation and usage
- **CA3**: Advanced concepts and integration

#### Lab Subjects:
- **CA1**: Basic tool setup and configuration
- **CA2**: Individual tool mastery
- **CA3**: Integration of multiple tools
- **CA4**: End-to-end implementation
