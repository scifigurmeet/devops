## 1. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) <a name="cicd"></a>

### Understanding CI/CD in Cloud-Native Environments

CI/CD is the backbone of modern software delivery, especially in cloud-native environments. Here's the basic workflow:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Code Changes] -->|Push| B[CI Pipeline]
    B -->|Build| C[Test]
    C -->|Pass| D[Artifact Creation]
    D -->|Deploy| E[CD Pipeline]
    E -->|Stage| F[Production]
    F -->|Monitor| G[Feedback]
```

### Key Components
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated build and test when code is pushed
- **Continuous Delivery**: Automated deployment to staging environments
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automated deployment to production

## 2. Advanced CI/CD Platforms <a name="platforms"></a>

### GitLab CI/CD Advanced Features
```mermaid
mindmap
  root((GitLab CI/CD))
    Multi-project Pipelines
      Parent-Child Pipelines
      Cross-project Dependencies
    Advanced Security
      SAST
      DAST
      Container Scanning
    Environment Management
      Review Apps
      Dynamic Environments
    Auto DevOps
      Auto Deploy
      Auto Test
      Auto Monitor
```

### GitHub Actions Advanced Workflows
- Matrix builds
- Reusable workflows
- Environment protection rules
- Custom actions

### Azure DevOps Pipelines
```mermaid

    A[Source Code] -->|Build| B[Build Pipeline]
    B -->|Artifacts| C[Release Pipeline]
    C -->|Deploy| D{Environments}
    D -->|Dev| E[Development]
    D -->|Stage| F[Staging]
    D -->|Prod| G[Production]
    H[Templates] -->|Reuse| B
    I[Variable Groups] -->|Configure| C
```

## 3. Deployment Strategies <a name="deployment"></a>

### Blue-Green Deployments in Kubernetes
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant LB as Load Balancer
    participant Blue as Blue Environment
    participant Green as Green Environment
    LB->>Blue: Route Traffic (100%)
    Note over Green: Deploy new version
    Note over Green: Test new version
    LB->>Green: Switch traffic
    Note over Blue: Keep as rollback option
```

### Canary Releases with Istio
```mermaid
pie title Traffic Distribution
    "Stable Version" : 90
    "Canary Version" : 10
```

Key concepts:
- Traffic splitting
- Progressive delivery
- Automated rollback
- Metrics-based promotion

## 4. Feature Management <a name="feature-management"></a>

### Feature Flags Implementation
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Feature Flag] -->|Evaluate| B{Condition}
    B -->|True| C[New Feature]
    B -->|False| D[Old Feature]
    E[User Context] -->|Input| B
    F[Environment] -->|Input| B
```

### A/B Testing in Cloud Environments
- User segmentation
- Metrics collection
- Statistical analysis
- Automated rollout

## 5. Development Workflows <a name="workflows"></a>

### Trunk-Based Development
```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit
    commit
    branch feature1
    checkout feature1
    commit
    checkout main
    merge feature1
    commit
    branch feature2
    checkout feature2
    commit
    checkout main
    merge feature2
```

### GitFlow Strategy
```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit
    branch feature
    checkout feature
    commit
    checkout develop
    merge feature
    branch release
    checkout release
    commit
    checkout main
    merge release
    checkout develop
    merge release
```

## Practice Questions
1. Compare and contrast Blue-Green and Canary deployment strategies.
2. How would you implement feature flags in a microservices architecture?
3. What are the key differences between GitFlow and Trunk-Based Development?
4. Design a CI/CD pipeline for a cloud-native application using GitHub Actions.
5. Explain the role of Istio in implementing Canary releases.
